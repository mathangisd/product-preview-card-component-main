## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Media Query
- Hover and Focus state for button

### What I learned

I used the media query to change the layout for desktop size. I was also able to use flexbox and grid properties.

### Continued-Development
I would like to keep working on other projects that involve different responsive layouts and also follow accessibility best practices.
